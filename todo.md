- [ ] Composable extension demo (Google Drive + Google Takeout)
- [ ] Reconciliation demo (Spotify)
    - only reconcile within app: trying to resolve with two different sources of truth (e.g. two weather services) isn't in Skybridge's purview
- [ ] Figure out triggers
    - [ ] Platform demo (Reminders)

### Future
- [ ] Multiple accounts / types of sync
    - multiple weather locations
- [ ] Start exploring event sourcing
    - would be good to use the same diffing algorithm for ingestion and eventual re-syncing
