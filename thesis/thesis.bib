  abstract = {REST APIs together with JSON are commonly used by modern web applications to export their services. However, these services are usually reachable in a pull mode which is not suitable for accessing changing data. Turning a service from a pull to a push mode is therefore frequently asked by web developers that want to get notified of changes. Converting a pull API into a push one obviously requires to make periodical calls to the API but also to create a patch between each successive version of the data. The latter is the most difficult part and this is where existing solutions have some imperfections. To face this issue, we present a new patch algorithm supporting move and copy change operations. Our evaluation done with real industrial data shows that our algorithm creates small patches compared with other libraries, and creates them faster.},

The so-called Right to Data Portability (RtDP) promises to significantly reduce switching costs for consumers in digital service markets, provided that its potential is effectively translated into reality. Thus, of all the consumer rights in the GDPR, the RtDP has the potential to be the one with the most significant implications for digital markets and privacy. However, our research shows that the RtDP is barely known among consumers and can currently only be implemented in a fragmented manner---especially with regard to the direct transfer of data between online service providers. We discuss several ways to improve the implementation of this right in the present article.},

  abstract = {Evolving software systems includes data schema changes, and because of those schema changes data has to be converted. Converting data between two different schemas while continuing the operation of the system is a challenge when that system is expected to be available always. Data conversion in event sourced systems introduces new challenges, because of the relative novelty of the event sourcing architectural pattern, because of the lack of standardized tools for data conversion, and because of the large amount of data that is stored in typical event stores. This paper addresses the challenge of schema evolution and the resulting data conversion for event sourced systems. First of all a set of event store upgrade operations is proposed that can be used to convert data between two versions of a data schema. Second, a set of techniques and strategies that execute the data conversion while continuing the operation of the system is discussed. The final contribution is an event store upgrade framework that identifies which techniques and strategies can be combined to execute the event store upgrade operations while continuing operation of the system. Two utilizations of the framework are given, the first being as decision support in upfront design of an upgrade system for event sourced systems. The framework can also be utilized as the description of an automated upgrade system that can be used for continuous deployment. The event store upgrade framework is evaluated in interviews with three renowned experts in the domain and has been found to be a comprehensive overview that can be utilized in the design and implementation of an upgrade system. The automated upgrade system has been implemented partially and applied in experiments.},

  abstract = {Data portability regulation has promised that individuals will be easily able to transfer their personal data between online service providers. Yet, after more than two years of an active privacy regulation regime in the European Union, this promise is far from being fulfilled. Given the lack of a functioning infrastructure for direct data portability between multiple providers, we investigate in our study how easily an individual could currently make use of an indirect data transfer between providers. We define such porting as a two-step transfer: firstly, requesting a data export from one provider, followed secondly by the import of the obtained data to another provider. To answer this question, we examine the data export practices of 182 online services, including the top one hundred visited websites in Germany according to the Alexa ranking, as well as their data import capabilities. Our main results show that high-ranking services, which primarily represent incumbents of key online markets, provide significantly larger data export scope and increased import possibilities than their lower-ranking competitors. Moreover, they establish more thorough authentication of individuals before export. These first empirical results challenge the theoretical literature on data portability, according to which, it would be expected that incumbents only complied with the minimal possible export scope in order to not lose exclusive consumer data to market competitors free-of-charge. We attribute the practices of incumbents observed in our study to the absence of an infrastructure realizing direct data portability.},

  abstract = {In recent years, online services have started to make personal data of users more accessible by offering dedicated ways of exporting data. The introduction of download portals is associated with increasing demands by privacy regulations regarding the rights of users, such as the Right of Access (Art. 15) and the Right to Data Portability (Art. 20) of the European Union's General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR). These rights aim to empower users by increasing their control over the personal data that online services hold about them. They allow users to export their personal data and thereby gain insights on the scope of personal data held by the services and to transfer this data to other services. However, until now, little is known about how users experience and evaluate the process of accessing and exporting their data and how it impacts individual-level factors such as privacy-related attitudes (i.e. attitudes regarding sharing personal data, perceived control over data, and using privacy-protective strategies). In this paper, we report the results of an online survey with an experimental condition (N = 728) and a second online survey (N = 817) where participants from two university courses were asked to request real data exports from online services and inspect the exported data afterward. We find that inspecting exported personal data has a statistically significant positive effect on users' privacy-related attitudes. However, users perceive limited usefulness in switching scenarios where personal data is transferred to a new substitutional service and rather prefer to use the data at multiple complementary services.},
