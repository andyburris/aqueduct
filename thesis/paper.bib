% please just use the bibtex copied from Google Scholar without changing the id (i.e. keep the qian2008blah id), and double check that it's correct because there's some minor error in it a third of the time. don't copy bibtex from any other websites
% that way we don't have to worry about duplicates, and you can \cite{} a paper with the same id every time (eventually being familiar with the papers enough to not have to check the .bib file for the id)

% example:
